===============================
CliNER
===============================

Clinical Named Entity Recognition system (CliNER) is an open-source natural language processing system for named entity recognition in clinical text of electronic health records. CliNER system is designed to follow best practices in clinical concept extraction, as established in i2b2 2010 shared task.

CliNER is implemented as a sequence classification task, where every token is predicted IOB-style as either: Problem, Test, Treatment, or None. Coomand line flags let you specify two different sequence classification algorithms:
    1. CRF (default) - with linguistic and domain-specific features
    2. LSTM

Please note that for optimal performance, CliNER requires the users to obtain a Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) license, since UMLS Metathesaurus is used as one of the knowledge sources for the above classifiers.

Optional Resources
--------

There are a few external resources that are not packaged with CliNER but can improve prediction performance for feature extraction with the CRF.

    GENIA

        **Why would I want this?** The GENIA tagger is a tool similar to CliNER but designed for Biomedical text. Depending on the domain of your data, this tool's pretrained model may or may not be able to improve performance for CliNER as it detects concepts.
        

        **reference** http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/GENIA/tagger/

        The GENIA tagger identifies named entities in biomedical text.
        
        > wget http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/GENIA/tagger/geniatagger-3.0.2.tar.gz
        
        > tar xzvf geniatagger-3.0.2.tar.gz
        
        > cd geniatagger-3.0.2
        
        > make
        
        
        **Edit config.txt so that GENIA references the geniatagger executable just built. (e.g. "GENIA   /someuser/CliNER/geniatagger-3.0.2/geniatagger")**

    UMLS
    
        **Why would I want this?** The UMLS, or Unified Medical Language System, is a very comprehensive database of various medical terms and concepts. Access to it would allow CliNER to leverage domain-specific knowledge.

        SORRY! This resource is contains potentially sensitive clinical data, and requires a confidentiality agreement. We can't do that part for you. Please see "Additional Resources" portion of this readme for instructions on how to obtain the UMLS tables.
        
        In order to use the UMLS tables, you must request a license. 
        See: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html

        How to obtain UMLS tables:
        
        - Download all the files from: https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html
        - Unzip mmsys.zip into a folder and put all other files downloaded into that folder.
        - Execute run_linux.sh and select 'Install UMLS' on gui.
        - Choose a destination for umls directory, hit 'Ok' and then 'Create New Config'.
        - Accept the agreement.
        - Select 'Only Active UMLS Sources' as your default subset.
        - Select 'Done' at the top right of gui pane and then select 'Begin Subset'.
        - This process may take a while, the directory '<Destination_Directory_Path>/<UMLS VERSION>/META' should contain the necessary files needed.
        
        You will need to get following tables: **LRARBR, MRREL.RRF, MRCONSO.RRF, MRSTY.RRF**
        
        **Put these tables in the $CLINER_DIR/umls_tables directory.**

        In order to tell CliNER that the tables are there, you must edit the file "$CLINER_DIR/config.txt" and change the line saying "UMLS  None" to "UMLS <path to dir containing tables>".

        **The database will be built from the tables when CliNER is run for the first time.**

Out-of-the-Box Model
--------

Although i2b2 licensing prevents us from releasing our cliner models trained on i2b2 data, we generated some comprable models from automatically-annotated MIMIC II text.

This silver MIMIC model can be found at http://text-machine.cs.uml.edu/cliner/models/silver.model


Additional Resources
--------

These are resources that require login credentials to access secure data, so we can't provide you with them directly.


i2b2 2010 shared task data

    The Data Use and Confidentiality Agreement (DUA) with i2b2 forbids us from redistributing the i2b2 data. In order to gain access to the data, you must go to:

    https://www.i2b2.org/NLP/DataSets/AgreementAR.php

    to register and sign the DUA. Then you will be able to request the data through them.



Example Data
--------

Although we cannot provide i2b2 data, there is a sample to demonstrate how the data is formatted (not actual data from i2b2, though).

    examples/ex_doc.txt

This is a text file. Discharge summaries are written out in plaintext, just like this. It is paired with a concept file, which has its annotations.

    examples/ex_doc.con

This is a concept file. It provides annotations for the concepts (problems, treatments, and tests) of the text file. The format is as follows - each instance of a concept has one line. The line shows the text span, the line number, token numbers of the span (delimited by white space), and the label of the concept.

**Please note that the example data is simply one of many examples that can found online.**

Usage
--------

Here are some use cases:

(1) Check that CliNER installed correctly

This help message will list the options available to run (train/predict/evaluate)

    cliner --help

(2) Training

These examples demonstrate how to build a CliNER model which can then be used for predicting concepts in text files.

    cliner train --txt examples/ex_doc.txt --annotations examples/ex_doc.con --format i2b2 --model models/foo.model

This example trains a very simple CliNER model. The (pretend.txt, pretend.con) pair form as the only document for learning to identify concepts. We must specify that these files are i2b2 format (even though the .con extension implies i2b2 format, you can never be too careful). The CliNER model is then serialized to models/foo.model as specified.

Please note that multiple files could be passed by enclosing them as a glob within "" quotes.

(3) Prediction

Once your CliNER model is built, you can use it to predict concepts in text files.

    cliner predict --txt examples/ex_doc.txt --out data/test_predictions/ --format i2b2 --model models/foo.model

In this example, we use the models/foo.model CliNER model that we built up above. This model is used to predict concepts in i2b2 format for the "ex_doc.txt" file. This generates a file named "ex_doc.con" and stores it in the specified output directory.

(4) Evaluation

This allows us to evaluate how well CliNER does by comparing it against a gold standard.

    cliner evaluate --txt examples/ex_doc.txt --gold examples --predictions data/test_predictions/ --format i2b2

Evaluate how well the system predictions did for given discharge summaries. The prediction and reference directories are provided with the --predictions and --gold flags, respectively. Both sets of data must be in the same format, and that format must be specified - in this case, they are both i2b2. This means that both the examples and data/test_predictions directories contain the file pretend.con.


Sample Result
--------

The cliner pipeline assumes that the clinical text has been preprocessed to be tokenized, as in accordance with the i2b2 format. We have included a simple tokenization script (see: `tools/tok.py`) that you can use or modify as you wish.

The silver model does come with some degradation of performance. Given that the alternative is no model, I think this is okay, but be aware that if you have the i2b2 training data, then you can build a model that performs even better on the i2b2 test data.
